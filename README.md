# Algo_Bot
Your personal assistant with algorithms

# Short Review

This bot can find you algorithmic articles on requested topics or send a random problem on Leetcode

# Presentation

Here is a short clip that represents, how Algo_Bot works:
https://youtu.be/2qRgQDVaE-Y

# What I used?

Here are a few things that I used while making this bot:

* Python telebot API
* Selenium package
* BeautifulSoup4 package

# What problems I faced?

* Never created telebots before, so I had to learn how to do it
* While creating the section about solving tasks, I understood that I can't collect data from Leetcode only with bs4 package, so I spent some time learning how to parse dynamic websites (Selenium package solved this problem)

# How you can run this bot?

* Install Python of version 3.8 (at least)
* Install *selenium, requests* and *bs4* packages
* Install a WebDriver for Google Chrome (or any other browser)
* Once you your WebDriver is installed insert the path to it in line 101 (if your WebDriver isn't for Google Chrome, then also change line 102)
* Run the code

Congratulate yourself!
